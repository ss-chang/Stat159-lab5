# Stat159-lab5

### Task1: 

UserA is creating commits, then UserB is pulling those commits and creating more commits. 
Everything is happening sequentially.

### Task2:

We made two independent changes on the same file and git doesn't know how to merge because 
they're different but on the same file in the same line. To deal with merge conflicts, we
manually removing the markers (<<<<<, ======, >>>>>) and choosing which code/text to keep.

### Task3:

UserB is creating a branch off of master. Like before, editing the same file at the same time
and place created merge conflicts between the master and task3b branch, so we fixed it
the same way we did before.

### Task4:

Now both of us are creating branches (task4A and task4B). However, no merge conflicts
occured this time around when we merged onto master because we were editing different 
files.
