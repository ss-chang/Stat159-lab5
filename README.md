# Stat159-lab5

### Task1: 

UserA is creating commits, then UserB is pulling those commits and creating more commits. 
Everything is happening sequentially.

### Task2:

We made two independent changes on the same file and git doesn't know how to merge because 
they're different but on the same file in the same line. To deal with merge conflicts, we
manually removing the markers (<<<<<, ======, >>>>>) and choosing which code/text to keep.

### Task3:

We're creating branches off of master. Like before, editing the same file at the same time
and place created merge conflicts between the master and task3b branch, so we fixed it
the same way we did before.
